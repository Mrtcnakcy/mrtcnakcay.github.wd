            <p>"He was a soldier-statesman, one of the greatest leaders of our era. He ensured that Turkey got its
                rightful
                place among the most advanced nations of the world. He has given to Turks the sense of self-confidence
                and
                endurance to the Turks, that forms the foundation stone of a nation's greatness. I take great pride in
                being
                one of Atatürk's loyal friends."</p>
